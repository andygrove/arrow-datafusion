# DataFusion Documentation

This folder contains the source content of the following guides:

- [User Guide]
- [Library Guide]
- [Contributor Guide]

These guides are published to https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/ as part of the release process.

## Dependencies

It's recommended to install build dependencies and build the documentation
inside a Python virtualenv.

Install Python and then use pip to install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Build & Preview

Run the provided script to build the HTML pages.

```shell
./build.sh
```

The HTML will be generated into a `build` directory.

Preview the site on Linux by running this command.

```shell
firefox build/html/index.html
```

## Making Changes

To make changes to the docs, simply make a Pull Request with your
proposed changes as normal. When the PR is merged the docs will be
automatically updated.

## Including Source Code

We want to make sure that all source code in the documentation is tested as part of the build and release process. We
achieve this by writing the code in standard Rust tests in the `datafusion-docs-test` crate, and annotate the code with
comments that mark the beginning and end of the code example.

```rust
//begin:my_example
let foo = 1 + 1;
//end:my_example
```

We can now put an `include` directive in the markdown file, specifying the name of the Rust file containing the test
and the name of the example.

```md
<!-- include: my_rust_file::my_example -->
```

## Release Process

This documentation is hosted at https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/

When the PR is merged to the `main` branch of the DataFusion
repository, a [github workflow](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml) which:

1. Builds the html content
2. Pushes the html content to the [`asf-site`](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/tree/asf-site) branch in this repository.

The Apache Software Foundation provides https://arrow.apache.org/,
which serves content based on the configuration in
[.asf.yaml](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/main/.asf.yaml),
which specifies the target as https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/.
